       <h2 >Unit 2</h2>
              <p>In this section I learned the basic tags to create a website with multiple pages. Before this unit, I didn't have the skills needed to create a webpage from scratch, which are required to code a website. This unit is essential to the coding process and sets up a website that will be built on to throughout the other units. Without this unit, any website I would code after this wouldn't be done correctly and wouldn't work.</p>
<br>
              <p> Some information I fould particularly informative in this unit is listed below:</p>

              <!-- Give these 'special' unordered lists a class name
              so you can target them uniquely in your css -->
              <ul class="special"> 
                  <li>How to link to other pages</li>
                  <li>Correct way to organize web files</li>
                  <li>How to add a video to a page</li>
                  <li>The importance of indenting tags</li>
              </ul>

  	   <h2>Unit 3</h2>
              <p>
      In this section I learned the basic coding needed to style a website. Also, I learned what the box model is and how it is applied to a website to make it look much better. The coding that I have learned are the necessary to build up the styling of a website. Any website created without these basic tags will not look as nice as it could with them. These unit is a great segway into being able to completely code a website. 
                  
      </p>
      <br>
             <p> Some information I fould particularly informative in this unit is listed below:</p>
          <ul class="special"> 
              <li>How to style a website</li>
              <li>How to use id and class tags</li>
              <li>How to use the box model</li>
          
          </ul>

       <h2>Unit 4</h2>
              <p>
     In this section I learned multiple skills that advance my knowledge of coding a website. A large part of this was linking images to my website. I had learned this before but forgot and was doing it the incorrect way. Also, I learned how to create an image and put in at the top of my website. This, similar to the other units, was an important tool in learning how to code a website.
                  
      </p>
      <br>
             <p> Some information I found particularly informative in this unit is listed below:</p>
          <ul class="special"> 
              <li>How to link an image</li>
              <li>How to create a banner</li>
              <li>How to create a background image that is tileable</li>
          
          </ul>

  	   <h2>Unit 5</h2>
              <p>
    In this section I learned how to use basic Javascript to enhance a webpage. Javascript, along with the other coding languanges learned from this ciriculum is very usful in creating an effective website. It is not a necessary tool for a website, but like CSS will make the website much better than it would be without. This unit is a very usful guide into the world of Javascript
                  
                  
                  
      </p>
      <br>
      <p> Some information I found particularly informative in this unit is listed below:</p>
      
      <ul class="special">
          <li>Basic Javascript information </li>
          <li>How to create a clock that updates automatically </li>

<li>How to add custom buttons that work to control a video</li>

          
          </ul>
  	   <h2>Unit 6</h2>
      <p>
          Even though this unit seemed a bit shorter than the others, it still offered a ton to learn. This unit focused on validating websites and testing our sites usability. I learned that there are tools that you can use to validate your website and make sure that there aren't any mistakes. This was another important unit that will lead into the next unit.3
           </p>
              <ul class="special">
      <li>
        Check for mistakes on your website  
    </li>
    <li>
    Use people to test the usability of your site
    </li>
      </ul>
