    <h1>Usability Study</h1>
    <br><br><br><br><br>
    <h2>Method:</h2>  What website did you study?: My Web Portflio
        <br><br>
    Who is the target audience?: Students in high school
    
<br><br>What three tasks did you assign to your subjects?: 
    <br><br> 
<ol>
<li>
Are you able to find my information including: my name, my school, my email, etc.      
</li>     
<li>
Is the purpose of the website clear across all page? 
</li>
<li>
Are the navigation tabs easy to navigate? 
</li>


</ol></h2>

<h2>
Results-                        
</h2>
 <br>
Were subjects able to complete the tasks you assigned them? Was it easy for them? How much time, or how many steps, did it take to complete the tasks?- 
          <br><br>Yes they were able to easily completed the tasks that were assigned. It took them around 1-2 minutes.
          <br>
    <h2>
          Discussion-</h2>
          <br>
   What did you learn from this study about the website? Is the current design effective? Why or why not? How might the site be designed differently so that users could more easily perform the representative tasks?
          
        <br>
          <br>
What I learned is that there are problems with the website that I hadn't previously seen, which made the design not effective. For some of the tabs the navigation bar would move when you moused over it. It could be designed differently so that it would work correctly.
